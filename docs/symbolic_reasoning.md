# Symbolic Reasoning in Kistmat_AI

## Overview

Symbolic reasoning is a critical component of the Kistmat_AI model, enabling it to understand and manipulate mathematical expressions symbolically. This capability allows the model to solve complex mathematical problems, simplify expressions, and apply mathematical rules effectively.

## SymbolicReasoner Class

The `SymbolicReasoner` class is designed to handle symbolic mathematics using the SymPy library. It provides functionalities to add symbols, define rules, apply these rules to expressions, and simplify expressions.

### Class Definition

```python
class SymbolicReasoner:
    def __init__(self):
        self.symbols = {}
        self.rules = []

    def add_symbol(self, name):
        self.symbols[name] = sp.Symbol(name)

    def add_rule(self, rule):
        self.rules.append(rule)

    def apply_rules(self, expression):
        for rule in self.rules:
            expression = expression.replace(rule)
        return expression

    def simplify(self, expression):
        return sp.simplify(expression)

    def symbolic_loss(self, predicted, actual):
        return tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(predicted - actual))
```

### Methods

- **`__init__`**: Initializes the `SymbolicReasoner` with empty dictionaries for symbols and rules.
- **`add_symbol(name)`**: Adds a new symbol to the reasoner.
- **`add_rule(rule)`**: Adds a new rule to the reasoner.
- **`apply_rules(expression)`**: Applies all defined rules to the given expression.
- **`simplify(expression)`**: Simplifies the given expression using SymPy's `simplify` function.
- **`symbolic_loss(predicted, actual)`**: Computes the symbolic loss between predicted and actual values.

## Integration with Kistmat_AI

The `SymbolicReasoner` is integrated into the Kistmat_AI model to enhance its problem-solving capabilities. The model uses symbolic reasoning to ensure consistency and correctness in its predictions.

### Example Usage

```python
from src.models.symbolic_reasoner import SymbolicReasoner

# Initialize the symbolic reasoner
reasoner = SymbolicReasoner()

# Add symbols
reasoner.add_symbol('x')
reasoner.add_symbol('y')

# Add rules
reasoner.add_rule(('x + y', 'y + x'))

# Simplify an expression
expression = 'x + y + x'
simplified_expression = reasoner.simplify(expression)
print(simplified_expression)  # Output: 2*x + y

# Apply rules to an expression
expression = 'x + y'
transformed_expression = reasoner.apply_rules(expression)
print(transformed_expression)  # Output: y + x
```

## Symbolic Loss Function

The `symbolic_loss` function is used to compute the loss between predicted and actual values in a symbolic manner. This function ensures that the model's predictions are not only numerically accurate but also symbolically consistent.

### Example Usage

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Predicted and actual values
predicted = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
actual = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])

# Compute symbolic loss
loss = reasoner.symbolic_loss(predicted, actual)
print(loss)  # Output: 0.0
```

## Conclusion

The `SymbolicReasoner` class is a powerful tool for enhancing the symbolic reasoning capabilities of the Kistmat_AI model. By integrating symbolic reasoning into the model, Kistmat_AI can solve complex mathematical problems more effectively and ensure the consistency and correctness of its predictions.
