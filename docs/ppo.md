# Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) in Kistmat_AI

## Overview

Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is a reinforcement learning algorithm that aims to improve the stability and reliability of policy gradient methods. PPO strikes a balance between exploration and exploitation by using a clipped objective function, which prevents large updates to the policy. This document provides an overview of how PPO is implemented in the Kistmat_AI model.

## PPOAgent Class

The `PPOAgent` class is responsible for implementing the PPO algorithm. It interacts with the Kistmat_AI model to train it using PPO. Below is a high-level overview of the `PPOAgent` class and its methods.

### Initialization

The `PPOAgent` class is initialized with the following parameters:

- `model`: The Kistmat_AI model to be trained.
- `learning_rate`: The learning rate for the optimizer.

```python
class PPOAgent:
    def __init__(self, model, learning_rate=0.001):
        self.model = model
        self.optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate)
```

### Training

The `train` method is responsible for training the model using PPO. It takes the following parameters:

- `states`: The input states for the model.
- `actions`: The actions taken by the model.
- `advantages`: The advantages calculated for the actions.

```python
def train(self, states, actions, advantages):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        predictions = self.model(states)
        loss = self.compute_loss(predictions, actions, advantages)
    grads = tape.gradient(loss, self.model.trainable_variables)
    self.optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, self.model.trainable_variables))
```

### Loss Calculation

The `compute_loss` method calculates the PPO loss. This method needs to be implemented to include the PPO-specific loss calculation, which typically involves a clipped objective function to prevent large updates.

```python
def compute_loss(self, predictions, actions, advantages):
    # Implement PPO loss calculation
    pass
```

## Integration with Kistmat_AI

The PPO algorithm is integrated into the Kistmat_AI training process. The `train_model` function in `src/main.py` is modified to use the `PPOAgent` for training.

### Example Usage

Below is an example of how to use the `PPOAgent` with the Kistmat_AI model:

```python
from src.models.kistmat_ai import Kistmat_AI
from src.models.ppo_agent import PPOAgent
from src.utils import generate_dataset

# Initialize the model
model = Kistmat_AI(input_shape=(50,), output_shape=2)

# Initialize the PPO agent
ppo_agent = PPOAgent(model)

# Generate a dataset
problems = generate_dataset(100, 'elementary1', 1.0)

# Train the model using PPO
states = [problem.problem for problem in problems]
actions = [problem.solution for problem in problems]
advantages = [1.0] * len(problems)  # Placeholder for advantages

ppo_agent.train(states, actions, advantages)
```

## Conclusion

The integration of PPO into the Kistmat_AI model enhances its training process by providing a more stable and reliable policy gradient method. The `PPOAgent` class encapsulates the PPO algorithm, making it easy to train the Kistmat_AI model using PPO.
